# Synaptic basis of a sub-second representation of time

This repository contains the c++ code used for carying out the simulations of the publication: "Synaptic basis of a sub-second representation of time".

## System and Software requirements

The code is written in c++ and requires the armadillo library (http://arma.sourceforge.net/) and the GNU scientific library (gsl, https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/).

Compilation and excecution of the code has been tested on Ubuntu 20.04 with gcc/g++ version 9.4.0., gsl version 2.6 and armadillo version 11.1.

No non-standard hardware is required to tun the program.

## Installation guide

To install the program, copy all file in a custom folder. The code comes with two folders that need to be in the main folder in order for the program to work correctly: 1) a folder named 'headers' which contains essential sub-routines; 2) a folder named 'output' into which the program will write the simulated data.

Copying the files and compiling the program should not take more than 5 minutes overall.

## comand line input
